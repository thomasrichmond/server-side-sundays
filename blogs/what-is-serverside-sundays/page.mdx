summary: "How I built my new blog site"

Server Side Sundays will be a blog where I will write all of my thoughts about tech
and all of its interesting happenings, with random releases on rainy Sundays when I am feeling bored or inspired.

Today I'll be touching on how I built the blog you are reading now, using React server components,
the Next.js `app` router and MDX.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why this stack?

These days, speed and performance are all the rage. We are moving away from bloated client heavy applications, and
moving closer and closer to server side applications becoming the norm (_for now, check in again in 2 years_). The framework that sits at the top of this list is React, particularly React Server Components.
This paired with the Next.js `app` router, allowed me to create a static blog site that is lightning fast and performant relatively easily. Content is managed through MDX, a markdown editor that allows you to insert JSX components into your markdown files, and give
your writing a little more flavour! The site is styled using Tailwind, allowing me to focus on the content rather than the design system around it.

## üìÑ How?

All blog posts are static, stored in a `/blogs` folder in the root of the project. Here there are folders named the title (and url slugs) of each blog.
Making the blog you are reading now `/blogs/what-is-serverside-sundays`. Inside of each blog folder, there is a `page.mdx` file, this is where the markdown lives. Keeping the blogs
static mixed with generating static routes at <Link href="https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/generate-static-params" target="_blank" label="build time" />, allows for the
lightning fast page transitions. No CMS content request, no medium blog fetch, there is nothing the client is waiting on.

The home page lives in a `page.tsx` file in the root of the `app` folder. This page can be interpreted as the entrypoint for your webpage.

Blog content is read in, filtered based on whether it is a directory (a folder), and mapped over returning the file content
and its corresponding route. **_This return statement can be any data structure / format you would like_**.

```js
const entries = await readdir("./blogs/", { withFileTypes: true });
const blogDirectories = entries.filter((blog) => blog.isDirectory());

const blogContent = Promise.all(
  blogDirectories.map(async (directory) => {
    return {
      fileContent: await readFile(`./blogs/${directory.name}/page.mdx`),
      route: `/${directory.name}`,
    };
  })
);

const parsedBlog = await blogContent;
```

Before rendering, blogs can also be optionally (_but highly recommended_), sorted by descending date. There are a million ways to skin this cat,
here is how I did it.

```js
const cardContent = parsedBlog.sort(function (a, b) {
  return (
    new Date(matter(b.fileContent).data.date).getTime() -
    new Date(matter(a.fileContent).data.date).getTime()
  );
});
```

```js
return (
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-10">
    {cardContent.map((blog) => {
      const { data, content } = matter(blog.fileContent);
      const readTime = Math.ceil(content.split(" ").length / 238);

      return (
        <Card
          key={`blog-${data.title}`}
          title={data.title}
          date={data.date}
          summary={data.summary}
          route={blog.route}
          readTime={readTime}
        />
      );
    })}
  </div>
);
```
