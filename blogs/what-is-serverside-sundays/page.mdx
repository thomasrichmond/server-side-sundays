summary: "How I built my new blog site"
---

Server Side Sundays will be a blog where I will write all of my thoughts about tech
and all of its interesting happenings, with random releases on rainy Sundays when I am feeling bored or inspired.

Today I'll be touching on how I built the blog you are reading now, using React server components,
the Next.js `app` router and MDX.

```js {5}
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

return (
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      setCount(count + 1);
    }}>
    Count: {count}
  </button>
);
```

This is my blog

<Counter />
<CounterTwo />
